# POKEDEXITO

The purpose of this project is to learn/practice React, once finished, it should:
- Fetch data from Pok√©API
- Have a clickable list of all Pokemon on the left
- Have a search bar on top with autocomplete
- Have the ability to display two selected Pokemon side by side, this way you can compare stats and at which level they learn certain moves

I'll probably serve it somewhere on the internet once it's finished.
To run just download, npm install and npm start
